## Introduction

**TkFreeChat** is an open-source chat server software released under the **AGPLv3 or higher** license.

## Features

1. Simple chat server supporting multi-user conversations.
2. No registration required to join the chat.

## Drawbacks

1. Lack of user authentication; anyone can use any username (due to the complexity of public-private key pairs for regular users).
2. The interface is not optimized for PC usage (CSS expertise needed for better PC compatibility).

## Recommendations

- Consider using **ngrok** for local network tunneling or set up a dedicated server.
